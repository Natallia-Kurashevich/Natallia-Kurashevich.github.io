            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>Our methodology is designed to systematically explore and enhance the knowledge of Giorgio Morandi’s landscapes. The key components of our methodology include utilizing ArCo to gather detailed metadata on Morandi and his works, querying databases with SPARQL to extract specific information and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich the knowledge graph with contextual information that enhance the understanding of the paintings.</p>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <p> The primary objectives of the project are: </p>
                <li> <strong> To Explore: </strong> Investigate the information that concerns Giorgio Morandi and his paintings "Paesaggio. Grizzana" and "View of the Montagnola of Bologna, Glimpse of a Garden".</li>
                <li> <strong> To Enhance Knowledge: </strong> Use SPARQL queries to collect and structure information. Enrich the existing knowledge graph with new data and insights generated by LLMs, thereby providing a deeper understanding of Morandi’s work. Create new knowledge triples.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="work-process">
            <h2>Work Process</h2>
            <p> <strong> Stage 1 </strong> - Data Exploration and SPARQL Query Formulation. We formulated SPARQL queries to extract detailed information about Morandi and his paintings.</p>
            <p> <strong> Stage 2 </strong> - Semantic Enrichment with LLMs and creation of new Knowledge Triples for Giorgio Morandi’s painting "Paesaggio. Grizzana".</p>
            <p> <strong> Stage 3 </strong> - Semantic Enrichment with LLMs and creation of new Knowledge Triples for Giorgio Morandi’s painting "View of the Montagnola of Bologna, Glimpse of a Garden".</p>
        </section>

        <section class="problems-solutions">
            <h2>Problems & Solutions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creating properly running SPARQL queries.</strong> The first problem that we faced was creating accurate SPARQL queries. For instance, in one of the queries, SELECT DISTINCT didn’t help to eliminate duplicates. With the help of the website <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>, a solution for the problem was <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28988702/distinct-only-on-one-value-with-sparql" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">found</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
            <li> <strong>Working with Large Language Models (LLMs).</strong> Integrating LLMs to generate relevant knowledge and insights posed challenges due to the models' tendency to produce inaccurate or ambiguous information. 
We addressed this issue by <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong> and <strong>Verification Process.</strong></li>
                </ul>
            <ul>
             <li> <strong>Creating a website for the project.</strong> Developing a user-friendly website to present the project's findings and methodology involved technical challenges.
We dealt with this problem with the help of <strong>continuous testing.</strong></li>
            </ul>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Our project achieved its primary objectives by successfully formulating SPARQL queries, utilizing Large Language Models, and creating new knowledge triples. This systematic approach allowed us to significantly enhance the ArCo knowledge graph, providing a more comprehensive understanding of Giorgio Morandi’s "Paesaggio. Grizzana" and "View of the Montagnola of Bologna, Glimpse of a Garden".</p>
            <p>Future developments for this project can significantly increase its scope, usability, and impact. By integrating additional data sources, implementing advanced analytics and developing interactive tools.</p>
